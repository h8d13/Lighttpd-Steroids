# Roadmap

- Remove all artifacts of automated test scripts and reimplement UUID logic at the OS level.
(Done for run.py file) still needs to be done for the rest.

- Create a setup.sh file that can do all the pre-req + setup steps in one go.
- Create a global style sheet (css) for the indexes to clean up
